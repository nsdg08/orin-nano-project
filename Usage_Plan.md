🛑 Drowsy Driving Prevention System Using YOLO

---

🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to develop an **intelligent safety system** that detects signs of drowsy driving using the real-time image classification and object detection capabilities of **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**.

By analyzing patterns such as **eye closure, blink rate, and head position**, the system will monitor the driver's state and issue early warnings when signs of fatigue are detected. This can significantly reduce the risk of traffic accidents caused by drowsiness.

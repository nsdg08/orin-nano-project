# üß† YOLO (You Only Look Once)

YOLO is a deep learning-based **real-time object detection algorithm** widely used in fields like surveillance, autonomous driving, drones, and robotics. It's known for its **speed and efficiency**.

## üìå Key Concept of YOLO

YOLO divides an image into a grid and predicts:
- **Object existence**
- **Location (bounding box)**
- **Class (type of object)**  
for each grid cell in **a single pass** through the network.

Unlike traditional object detection methods, YOLO **looks at the entire image once**, making it fast and ideal for real-time applications.

## üß† How YOLO Works (Simplified)

1. **Input image** is resized (e.g., 416x416).
2. Passed through a **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**.
3. Outputs a tensor of shape: `S √ó S √ó (B √ó 5 + C)` where:
   - `S`: Grid size (e.g., 13√ó13)
   - `B`: Number of bounding boxes per grid cell
   - `C`: Number of classes
   - `5`: x, y, width, height, confidence score

Example output for a detected object (e.g., person):
- `x, y`: Center of the bounding box
- `w, h`: Width and height of the box
- `confidence`: Probability of object presence
- `class_probs`: Probabilities for each class (e.g., person, dog, car)
